This code is the result of the video tutorial https://youtu.be/25G6hjUUIEc for teachers who want to implement this project to their class. 
The Collector file is the basic game that you can demostrate for students as a lesson's quick off. Make sure that you download the Images folder to the same folder where your game is and feel free to play iwth the other images added to the folder.

If you are planning on differentiating your lesson and some students need a template to work with, then the CollectorTemplate is the file you need. 
The SuperCollector file is the modification of the game to have the Car picking Passanger instead of the Fox collecting Coins.
